# :wave: Welcome to the API Test Project by Alex Mahler:wave: 

You'll notice there are two branches here, one is called **feature/postman** and the is **feature/supertest**. I decided to do the implementation with both Postman and one with Supertest. In each branch, you will find the instructions on how to setup and run each projects. 

Thanks again for taking the time to look at the project.
